With the help of his best friend Darwin, his former pet goldfish that grew legs and joined the family, he gets into all sorts of antics. He is joined by his sister, Anais, a four-year-old bunny with heightened intelligence. His father, Richard, and his mother, Nicole, are there to provide him support as well.</p>

                            <p>The show revolves around life on a cul-de-sac, focusing on three friends who have nearly identical names: Ed, Edd, and Eddy.

Throughout the show, the trio create numerous scams in order to make money to earn jawbreakers. They also have to deal with numerous misadventures, such as being ostracized from other kids in the cul-de-sac, as well as avoiding the Kanker sisters, who live in a nearby trailer and whom the Eds and the cul-de-sac as a whole despise.</p>
