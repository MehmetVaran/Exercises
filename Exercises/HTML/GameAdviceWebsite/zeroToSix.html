                            <p>Parents need to know that Octonauts & the Great Barrier Reef is a special from the Octonauts TV series that raises issues related to environmental protection for vulnerable ecosystems and the Great Barrier Reef in particular.

It's a friendly and feel-good way to broach the subject of conservation with preschoolers, and its very happy ending leaves viewers feeling hopeful. The Octonauts prove themselves to be helpers extraordinaire, able to problem solve on the fly and use the resources available to them to do so. This story promotes environmental awareness, community responsibility, teamwork, and compassion, and boasts some fantastic original music.</p>
